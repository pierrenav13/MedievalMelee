## Background

  Medieval Melee is a 2D game where a player must avoid a boss that is bouncing around the stage. The boss gets faster each time it hits an edge of the stage. As time goes on, the boss will get faster and faster as you try to stay out of its path. This continues until the player is caught and gets their score based on how long they survived.
